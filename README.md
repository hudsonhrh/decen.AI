# Decen.AI

Developing a fully open-source decentralized artificial intelligence system that is governed by the community. This is a step-by-step guide on how we plan to achieve this, and we invite you to join us in this exciting journey.

## Phase 1: Building a Basic AI agent that interfaces with Blockchain

Our initial task is to create a basic GPT AI agent. This agent will serve as the foundation of our AI system, providing the core functionality that will be expanded upon in later stages.

### Step 1: Connecting the AI to the Blockchain

The next step is to connect the GPT API to the blockchain. We will accomplish this by using langChain and Web3.py to transfer data to the model. This will allow our AI agent to interact with the blockchain, opening up a wide range of possibilities for data access and transaction processing.

### Step 2: Utilizing Subgraphs on The Graph Protocol

The following step in our initial setup involves pulling data from subgraphs on The Graph protocol. Subgraphs are a powerful tool for indexing blockchain data, and by integrating them into our AI agent, we can provide it with a rich source of information to draw upon.

We aim to create a decentralized AI that is not only powerful and versatile, but also governed by the community it serves. This is the vision of Decen.AI.

## Phase 2: Decentralization and AI Model Tuning

Now that we have a basic AI that can read blockchain data, we can start fine-tuning the model for the applications we want to prioritize. Simultaneously, we also focus on decentralizing the AI as much as possible to guarantee:

1. No centralization at any level to ensure uptime and censorship resistance
2. No gatekeepers controlling access to the AI, ensuring that it remains accessible to all users
3. A community-driven governance model that allows for transparency and accountability in decision-making.

In order to achieve these goals, we will be taking the following steps:

### Step 1: Implementing a Decentralized Storage Solution

We will be implementing a decentralized storage solution such as IPFS or Swarm to ensure that the AI's data is stored in a distributed and secure manner.

### Step 2: Developing a Community Governance Model

We will be developing a community governance model that allows for transparent decision-making and ensures that the AI remains accountable to its users through a DAO like structure

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning the AI Model

Finally, we will be fine-tuning the AI model to ensure that it is optimized for the specific applications we want to prioritize. This will involve testing and iterating on the model to ensure that it is performing as intended.

Overall, our goal is to create a decentralized AI system that is not only powerful and versatile, but also accountable to its users and governed by the community. We believe that this is a crucial step in the development of the space, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this exciting new technology.
